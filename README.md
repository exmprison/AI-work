### 1. Introduction
The **AI Quiz Solver** is a Chrome extension designed to help you solve quizzes and questions on any webpage. It works by analyzing the text and interactive elements on a page, and then using a powerful AI model (Google's Gemini) to determine the correct answers. The extension then automatically interacts with the page to fill in the answers for you.

***

### 2. How It Works
The extension operates in three main steps:
1.  **Scraping**: When you click the "Solve" button, the extension scrapes all the visible text and interactive elements (like buttons and input fields) from the current webpage.
2.  **AI Analysis**: The scraped data is sent to the Gemini AI model, which analyzes the content to identify questions and select the correct answers. The model returns a list of actions to be performed on the page.
3.  **Automation**: The extension then takes the list of actions from the AI and automatically clicks the correct buttons or types text into the appropriate fields, solving the quiz for you.

### 3. Features
* **Dual Model Support**: Choose between **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for fast and efficient solving or **Gemini 2.5 Pro** for more complex and accurate problem-solving.
* **Automatic Interaction**: The extension automatically performs the necessary clicks and text inputs.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple popup with a clear status message.

### 7. Troubleshooting
* **Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')**: This usually means the AI has blocked the content of the page due to safety concerns. Try the Pro model, or check your page content for anything that might be flagged.
* **"Error: API call failed"**: Double-check that your API key is correct and that it has not been revoked.
* **"Error: API Key is missing"**: Ensure you have created and saved your API key in a file named `key.txt` in the root of the extension folder.
* **Extension not loading**: Make sure **Developer mode** is enabled on the `chrome://extensions` page.
